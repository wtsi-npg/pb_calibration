Installation
============

To install this software, you first need to get and install the Staden
io_lib package (version 1.12.1 or newer).  This can be obtained from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/staden/files/ or alternatively you may
be able to download it as a pre-built package for your OS distribution.

You also need 'zlib'.  In the unlikely event that you don't have this already
it is available from http://www.zlib.net/.

Note that if you install packaged versions of io_lib and zlib, you will need
the development versions in order to get the include files etc. needed to
build software that uses them.

When you have installed io_lib, you can build this package using:

./configure
make
make check                  # Optional
make install


The configure script takes a few options.  The most useful are:

 --prefix=PREFIX      Install somewhere other than the
                      default location (/usr/local).
 --with-io_lib=DIR    Look for io_lib in DIR.
 --with-zlib=DIR      Look for zlib in DIR.

The --with- options are needed if you have installed io_lib or zlib in
non-standard locations and the configure script can't find them by itself.

Run './configure --help' to see a list of other options available.

Make check requires perl, along with the File::Temp and Getopt::Long modules.
It makes artificial Illumina analysis software directories in /tmp,
converts them to SRF and then checks the resulting files.  You will need
0.5GB of free space in /tmp to run the tests.

Subdirectory Builds
============ ======

You can also build in a subdirectory, which is useful if you want to build
for different architectures or with different options.  It also helps
to keep the source directories tidy.  To do a subdirectory build, use:

mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make check               # Optional
make install

Missing configure script
======= ========= ======

If you do not have a configure script (e.g. because you checked out the
Subversion repository instead of downloading a release tarball), you will need
to build one.  This requires GNU autoconf and automake, which can be obtained
either from your OS distribution or from http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
and http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/.

With autoconf and automake installed, you should be able to run:

./bootstrap

in the main package directory to create a new configure script.  Then follow
the instructions above.
